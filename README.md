# matplotlib-challenge
## Pymaceuticals Inc.

In this challenge I spent a lot more time referring back to class modules and exercises than previous ones.
Below I cover the places where I struggled or had to source code from outside sources.

I had to work with other classmates to arrive at some of the answers, along with having to ask for help during 
odffice hours.

### Setting and resetting index

When cleaning my data, I had to search for every instance of a specific "Mouse ID", this was made easier by setting the "Mouse ID"
to index and then resetting it back once my data was cleaned.

### Summary statistics with aggregation

The link below made it easy to figure out the correct syntax.

### Correlation and Regression

For this section code from class covered in "Module 5.3-08-Ins_Fits_and_Regression example" was exactly what we needed to complete the cell.
